        <h1>Miguel Andrade</h1>
        <h2>Graduate student from CSULB</h2>

        <p> Graduated from California State University, Long Beach, with a Bachelor's in Business Administration, Management Information Systems.</p>
        <p>My goal is to leverage my analytical, technical, and financial knowledge to transform higher education program administration, making it more intuitive, fiscally responsible, and effective for research teams, teachers, administrators, and TOSA. I'm passionate about creating an environment where these vital groups can thrive through optimized systems, clear data insights, and seamless operational and financial support.</p>
        <p>I honed my skills in financial and program administration by successfully managing categorical grants for three state-funded programs at Orange Coast College. This experience provided me with a deep understanding of fiscal responsibility, data tracking, and reporting, which are crucial for effective resource stewardship.</p>
        <p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I maintain a keen interest in technology, business intelligence, management, and finance, which continuously fuels my drive for innovation and efficiency. In my time, I enjoy travel and photography, exploring new perspectives and capturing the world around me.</p>
